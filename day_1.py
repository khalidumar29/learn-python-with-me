# This script covers the basics of Python including pip, basic modules, comments, print function, and escape sequences.

# ==========================
# Part 1: Using pip
# ==========================
# pip is a package manager for Python that allows you to install additional packages from the Python Package Index (PyPI).
# To install a package using pip, you can use the command:
# pip install package_name
# For example:
# pip install requests

# ==========================
# Part 2: Basic Modules
# ==========================
# Modules are Python files that contain functions, classes, and variables that can be imported into other Python files.

# Example of importing a basic module (math module)
import math

# Using a function from the math module
square_root = math.sqrt(25)  # This will calculate the square root of 25
print("The square root of 25 is:", square_root)

# ==========================
# Part 3: Comments in Python
# ==========================
# Comments are used to explain the code and are ignored by the Python interpreter.

# Single-line comment

"""
Multi-line comment
or docstring, often used
to describe a function or module
"""

# ==========================
# Part 4: Print Function
# ==========================
# The print function is used to display output to the console.

# Basic usage of print function
print("Hello, World!")

# Print with multiple arguments
print("Hello,", "World!")

# ==========================
# Part 5: Escape Sequences
# ==========================
# Escape sequences are used to represent certain special characters within strings.

# Newline character
print("Hello,\nWorld!")

# Tab character
print("Hello,\tWorld!")

# Backslash character
print("This is a backslash: \\")

# Single quote character
print('This is a single quote: \'')

# Double quote character
print("This is a double quote: \"")

# ==========================
# Summary
# ==========================
# In this script, we covered:
# 1. Using pip to install Python packages.
# 2. Importing and using basic Python modules.
# 3. Different types of comments in Python.
# 4. The print function and its basic uses.
# 5. Various escape sequences in strings.
